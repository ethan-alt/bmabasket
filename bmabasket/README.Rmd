  <!-- badges: end -->

The goal of bmabasket is to simulate basket trial data based on hyperparameters and analyze things such as
the family-wise error rate, bias, and MSE. The package uses Bayesian model average (BMA) to compute
the posterior probability that response within a basket exceeds some threshold.

## Installation

You can install the released version of bmabasket from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("bmabasket")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ethan-alt/bmabasket")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(bmabasket)
## REPEAT SIMS FROM BIOSTATISTICS JOURNAL PUBLICATION
nSims      <- 100             ## change to ~250000 to repeat journal results

K0         <- 5

rRatesMod  <- matrix(rNull,(K0+1)+3,K0)
rRatesNull <- rep(rNull,K0)
rRatesMid  <- rep(rTarg,K0)
eRatesMod  <- rep(1, K0)

## min and max #' of new subjects per basket before next analysis (each row is interim)
minSSEnr <- matrix(rep(mss, K0), nrow=nInterim ,ncol=K0, byrow=TRUE) 
maxSSEnr <- matrix(rep(100, K0), nrow=nInterim, ncol=K0, byrow=TRUE) 

## construct matrix of rates
for (i in 1:K0)  
{
  rRatesMod[(i+1):(K0+1),i]= rTarg     
}
rRatesMod[(K0+2),] <- c(0.05,0.15,0.25,0.35,0.45)
rRatesMod[(K0+3),] <- c(0.15,0.30,0.30,0.30,0.45)
rRatesMod[(K0+4),] <- c(0.15,0.15,0.30,0.30,0.30)

## conduct simulation of trial data and analysis
x <- bma_design(
  nSims, K0, K0, eRatesMod, rRatesMod[i+1,], meanTime, sdTime, 
  ppEffCrit, ppFutCrit, as.logical(futOnly), rRatesNull, rRatesMid,

  phi0, priorModelProbs = NULL, pmp0 = pmp0
)
